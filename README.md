# Welcome to FishingBuddies


FishingBuddies is an app that makes every lonely fisherman happy. With an integrated map, you can set a preferred location and create a fishing day.
This created fishing day can be joined by other users and you can join fishing days as well. So you can spend a nice fishing day with other fishermen.

# How it Works


### "MAP" Page

Clicking on a preferred location on the map opens a form where you enter some information about your target fish, the waters and the date and time you want to fish. After you submit the form, a fishing day will be created and a marker will be saved on the map. You can also open fishing days created by other users by clicking on the marker and join and leave the fishing day.

### "MEINE ANGELTAGE" Page

All fishing days in which you participate will be displayed on this page, so you have a good overview of your planned fishing days. Here you can leave fishing days as well.

### "PROFIL" Page

Each user has a profile page with information about themselves and also catch photos can be uploaded here.
